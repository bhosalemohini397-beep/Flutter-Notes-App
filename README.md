# notes

A simple **Notes App** built with **Flutter** using:
- **Bloc** for state management
- **Repository pattern** for data handling
- **Mock API service** for CRUD operations
- **Singleton pattern** to persist in-memory notes across screens

## Getting Started

## Prompts given for deciding project structure
  
-Act as a flutter developer and generate a Flutter project folder structure for a Notes app with three screens (Notes List, Add/Edit Note, Note Details) using Bloc for state management and API   integration with a mock service.

-Create a flutter api repository that has basic CRUD operations functions 

-How It Fits in Clean Architecture

-Give me a response json for this

-Why do I need dependency injection for this?

##Small app or quick prototype → skip DI if you want.
##App with multiple features, shared services, or that will grow → DI saves pain later.

## Prompts given for UI :
- You are a flutter developer, now convert this appbar code to generic one :
AppBar(
          automaticallyImplyLeading: false,
          backgroundColor: AppColors.border,
          title: Text('NOTES'),
        )

- Act as a flutter developer who also has an experience with basic UI design give a suitable splash screen for a simple notes app
